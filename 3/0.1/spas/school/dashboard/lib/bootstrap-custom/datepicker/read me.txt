Bootstrap 0.6.0 didn't work properly with angular 1.1.5, so I used 0.5.0, which did
However... bootstrap datepicker 0.5.0 didn't work properly with angular 1.1.5, but 0.6.0 did
Therefore... I've used datepicker 0.6.0 and other 0.5.0 (with angular 1.1.5)

Everything should stabalise with angular 1.2.0 in the next few months
Therefore... when that happens can update everything accordingly
